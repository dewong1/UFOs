# UFOs
Create a table (on a new webpage) to organize UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array or list. 

## Overview of Project

We created a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array or list. This table have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria (e.g. *date*). JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhanced HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. After we build the table using data stored in a JavaScript array, we customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and then equipped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. The purpose of this project was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter multiple criteria (*date*, *city*, *state*, *country*, and *shape*) at the same time.

## Results

Below is a screenshot of the UFO sightings (new webpage):

### Walkthrough on how to use new webpage 

A quick walkthrough of how to use the webpage. It is super easy and straightforward. On the left bottom corner of the webpage will be a *Filter Search* form section. Under the *Filter Search* form section, there will be a white input textbox for the following criteria: *date*, *city*, *state*, *country*, and *shape*. If a user wants to filter the UFO data by the *date* 1/10/2010, all the user have to do is just input that date (1/10/2010) into the white input textbook. Afterwards, the table will automatically filter the results according to the inputted text. 

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is the static aspect of the data presented on this webpage. It is great for users who are only looking for the specific UFO sighitngs data provided on this webpage (and thankfully for the filters to add convenience). However, this webpage is not considerably a live webpage with live interactions (e.g. no comment/chat section or live update/data). Two recommendations for further development will probably be a comment/thread section for users to interact and discuss ideas with each other regarding the UFO sightings data. Another recommendation will probably be to make the webpage available on additional devices (i.e. phone, ipad, etc.) to provide device convenience for users conducting data research on UFO sightings related data.
