# UFOs
Create a table (on a new webpage) to organize UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array or list. 

## Overview of Project

We created a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array or list. This table have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria (e.g. *date*). JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhanced HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. After we build the table using data stored in a JavaScript array, we customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and then equipped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. The purpose of this project was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter multiple criteria (*date*, *city*, *state*, *country*, and *shape*) at the same time.
